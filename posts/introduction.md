This is the directory, or volume, that will contain all of my blog posts.

I will try to keep blog posts short, and keep them focused on my projects and ideas. My posts will occasionally be on random topics that I find interesting.

I don't have any schedule in mind, so blog posts may be few and far in between. Currently, I am a junior in high school, so I don't have all the time in the world to work on these.

My ultimate goal is that someone can read these, or just use this website, and learn or gain something from it.
